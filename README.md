# Diffview.nvim

Single tabpage interface for easily cycling through diffs for all modified files
for any git rev.

![preview](.github/media/screenshot_2.png)

## Introduction

Vim's diff mode is pretty good, but there is no convenient way to quickly bring
up all modified files in a diffsplit. This plugin aims to provide a simple,
unified, single tabpage, interface that lets you easily review all changed files
for any git rev.

## Requirements

- Git
- Neovim >=0.5.0
- [nvim-web-devicons](https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-web-devicons) (optional) For file icons

## Installation

Install the plugin with your package manager of choice.

```vim
" Plug 
Plug 'sindrets/diffview.nvim'
```

```lua
-- Packer
use 'sindrets/diffview.nvim'
```

## Configuration

```lua
-- Lua
local cb = require'diffview.config'.diffview_callback

require'diffview'.setup {
  diff_binaries = false,    -- Show diffs for binaries
  file_panel = {
    width = 35,
    use_icons = true        -- Requires nvim-web-devicons
  },
  key_bindings = {
    disable_defaults = false,                   -- Disable the default key bindings
    -- The `view` bindings are active in the diff buffers, only when the current
    -- tabpage is a Diffview.
    view = {
      ["<tab>"]     = cb("select_next_entry"),  -- Open the diff for the next file 
      ["<s-tab>"]   = cb("select_prev_entry"),  -- Open the diff for the previous file
      ["<leader>e"] = cb("focus_files"),        -- Bring focus to the files panel
      ["<leader>b"] = cb("toggle_files"),       -- Toggle the files panel.
    },
    file_panel = {
      ["j"]             = cb("next_entry"),         -- Bring the cursor to the next file entry
      ["<down>"]        = cb("next_entry"),
      ["k"]             = cb("prev_entry"),         -- Bring the cursor to the previous file entry.
      ["<up>"]          = cb("prev_entry"),
      ["<cr>"]          = cb("select_entry"),       -- Open the diff for the selected entry.
      ["o"]             = cb("select_entry"),
      ["<2-LeftMouse>"] = cb("select_entry"),
      ["-"]             = cb("toggle_stage_entry"), -- Stage / unstage the selected entry.
      ["S"]             = cb("stage_all"),          -- Stage all entries.
      ["U"]             = cb("unstage_all"),        -- Unstage all entries.
      ["X"]             = cb("restore_entry"),      -- Restore entry to the state on the left side.
      ["R"]             = cb("refresh_files"),      -- Update stats and entries in the file list.
      ["<tab>"]         = cb("select_next_entry"),
      ["<s-tab>"]       = cb("select_prev_entry"),
      ["<leader>e"]     = cb("focus_files"),
      ["<leader>b"]     = cb("toggle_files"),
    }
  }
}
```

The diff windows can be aligned either with a horizontal split or a vertical
split. To change the alignment add either `horizontal` or `vertical` to your
`'diffopt'`.

## Usage

### `:DiffviewOpen [git rev] [args] [ -- {paths...}]`

Calling `:DiffviewOpen` with no args opens a new Diffview that compares against
the current index. You can also provide any valid git rev to view only changes
for that rev. Examples:

- `:DiffviewOpen`
- `:DiffviewOpen HEAD~2`
- `:DiffviewOpen HEAD~4..HEAD~2`
- `:DiffviewOpen d4a7b0d`
- `:DiffviewOpen d4a7b0d..519b30e`

You can also provide additional paths to narrow down what files are shown:

- `:DiffviewOpen HEAD~2 -- lua/diffview plugin`

For information about additional `[args]`, visit the [documentation](https://github.com/sindrets/diffview.nvim/blob/main/doc/diffview.txt).

Additional commands for convenience:

- `:DiffviewClose`: Close the current diffview. You can also use `:tabclose`.
- `:DiffviewToggleFiles`: Toggle the files panel.
- `:DiffviewFocusFiles`: Bring focus to the files panel.
- `:DiffviewRefresh`: Update stats and entries in the file list of the current
  Diffview.

With a Diffview open and the default key bindings, you can cycle through changed
files with `<tab>` and `<s-tab>` (see configuration to change the key bindings).

## Tips

- **Hide untracked files:**
  - `DiffviewOpen -uno`
- **Exclude certain paths:**
  - `DiffviewOpen -- :!exclude/this :!and/this`
- **Run as if git was started in a specific directory:**
  - `DiffviewOpen -C/foo/bar/baz`
- **Diff the index against a git rev:**
  - `DiffviewOpen HEAD~2 --cached`
  - Defaults to `HEAD` if no rev is given.

## Restoring Files

If the right side of the diff is showing the local state of a file, you can
restore the file to the state from the left side of the diff (key binding `X`
from the file panel by default). The current state of the file is stored in the
git object database, and a command is echoed that shows how to undo the change.
