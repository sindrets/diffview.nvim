# Diffview.nvim

Single tabpage interface for easily cycling through diffs for all modified files
for any git rev.

![preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2786478/131269942-e34100dd-cbb9-48fe-af31-6e518ce06e9e.png)


## Introduction

Vim's diff mode is pretty good, but there is no convenient way to quickly bring
up all modified files in a diffsplit. This plugin aims to provide a simple,
unified, single tabpage interface that lets you easily review all changed files
for any git rev.

## Requirements

- Git ≥ 2.31.0
- Neovim ≥ 0.7.0
- [plenary.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim)
- [nvim-web-devicons](https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-web-devicons) (optional) For file icons

## Installation

Install the plugin with your package manager of choice.

```vim
" Plug
Plug 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim'
Plug 'sindrets/diffview.nvim'
```

```lua
-- Packer
use { 'sindrets/diffview.nvim', requires = 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim' }
```

## Merge Tool

![merge tool showcase](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2786478/188286293-13bbf0ab-3595-425d-ba4a-12f514c17eb6.png)

Opening a diff view during a merge or a rebase will list the conflicted files in
their own section. When opening a conflicted file, it will open in a 3-way diff
allowing you to resolve the merge conflicts with the context of the target
branch's version, as well as the version from the branch which is being merged.

The 3-way diff is only the default layout for merge conflicts. There are
multiple variations on this layout, a 4-way diff layout, and a single window
layout available.

In addition to the normal `:h copy-diffs` mappings, there are default mappings
provided for jumping between conflict markers, obtaining a hunk directly from
any of the diff buffers, and accepting any one, all, or none of the versions of
a file given by a conflict region.

For more information on the merge tool, mappings, layouts and how to
configure them, see:

- `:h diffview-merge-tool`
- `:h diffview-config-view.x.layout`

## File History

![file history showcase](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2786478/188331057-f9ec9a0d-8cda-4ff8-ac98-febcc7aa4010.png)

The file history view allows you to list all the commits that affected a given
set of paths, and view the changes made in a diff split. This is a porcelain
interface for git-log, and supports a good number of its options. Things like:

- Filtering commits by grepping commit messages and commit authors.
- Tracing the line evolution of a given set of line ranges for multiple files.
- Only listing changes for a specific commit range, branch, or tag.
- Following file changes through renames.

Get started by opening file history for:

- The current branch: `:DiffviewFileHistory`
- The current file: `:DiffviewFileHistory %`

For more info, see `:h :DiffviewFileHistory`.

## Usage

### `:DiffviewOpen [git rev] [options] [ -- {paths...}]`

Calling `:DiffviewOpen` with no args opens a new Diffview that compares against
the current index. You can also provide any valid git rev to view only changes
for that rev.

Examples:

- `:DiffviewOpen`
- `:DiffviewOpen HEAD~2`
- `:DiffviewOpen HEAD~4..HEAD~2`
- `:DiffviewOpen d4a7b0d`
- `:DiffviewOpen d4a7b0d^!`
- `:DiffviewOpen d4a7b0d..519b30e`
- `:DiffviewOpen origin/main...HEAD`

You can also provide additional paths to narrow down what files are shown:

- `:DiffviewOpen HEAD~2 -- lua/diffview plugin`

For information about additional `[options]`, visit the
[documentation](https://github.com/sindrets/diffview.nvim/blob/main/doc/diffview.txt).

Additional commands for convenience:

- `:DiffviewClose`: Close the current diffview. You can also use `:tabclose`.
- `:DiffviewToggleFiles`: Toggle the file panel.
- `:DiffviewFocusFiles`: Bring focus to the file panel.
- `:DiffviewRefresh`: Update stats and entries in the file list of the current
  Diffview.

With a Diffview open and the default key bindings, you can cycle through changed
files with `<tab>` and `<s-tab>` (see configuration to change the key bindings).

#### Staging

You can stage individual hunks by editing any buffer that represents the index
(after running `:DiffviewOpen` with no `[git-rev]` the entries under "Changes"
will have the index buffer on the left side, and the entries under "Staged
changes" will have it on the right side). Once you write to an index buffer the
index will be updated.

### `:[range]DiffviewFileHistory [paths] [options]`

Opens a new file history view that lists all commits that affected the given
paths. This is a porcelain interface for git-log. Both `[paths]` and
`[options]` may be specified in any order, even interchangeably.

If no `[paths]` are given, defaults to the top-level of the working tree. The
top-level will be inferred from the current buffer when possible, otherwise the
cwd is used. Multiple `[paths]` may be provided and git pathspec is supported.

If `[range]` is given, the file history view will trace the line evolution of the
given range in the current file (for more info, see the `-L` flag in the docs).

Examples:

- `:DiffviewFileHistory`
- `:DiffviewFileHistory %`
- `:DiffviewFileHistory path/to/some/file.txt`
- `:DiffviewFileHistory path/to/some/directory`
- `:DiffviewFileHistory include/this and/this :!but/not/this`
- `:DiffviewFileHistory --range=origin..HEAD`
- `:DiffviewFileHistory --range=feat/example-branch`
- `:'<,'>DiffviewFileHistory`

  },
})

### Hooks

The `hooks` table allows you to define callbacks for various events emitted from
Diffview. The available hooks are documented in detail in
`:h diffview-config-hooks`. The hook events are also available as User
autocommands. See `:h diffview-user-autocmds` for more details.

Examples:

```lua
hooks = {
  diff_buf_read = function(bufnr)
    -- Change local options in diff buffers
    vim.opt_local.wrap = false
    vim.opt_local.list = false
    vim.opt_local.colorcolumn = { 80 }
  end,
  view_opened = function(view)
    print(
      ("A new %s was opened on tab page %d!")
      :format(view:class():name(), view.tabpage)
    )
  end,
}
```

### Keymaps

The keymaps config is structured as a table with sub-tables for various
different contexts where mappings can be declared. In these sub-tables
key-value pairs are treated as the `{lhs}` and `{rhs}` of a normal mode
mapping. These mappings all use the `:map-arguments` `silent`, `nowait`, and
`noremap`. The implementation uses `vim.keymap.set()`, so the `{rhs}` can be
either a vim command in the form of a string, or it can be a lua function:

```lua
  view = {
    -- Vim command:
    ["a"] = "<Cmd>echom 'foo'<CR>",
    -- Lua function:
    ["b"] = function() print("bar") end,
  }
```

For more control (i.e. mappings for other modes), you can also define index
values as list-like tables containing the arguments for `vim.keymap.set()`.
This way you can also change all the `:map-arguments` with the only exception
being the `buffer` field, as this will be overridden with the target buffer
number:

```lua
view = {
  -- Normal and visual mode mapping to vim command:
  { { "n", "v" }, "<leader>a", "<Cmd>echom 'foo'<CR>", { silent = true } },
  -- Visual mode mapping to lua function:
  { "v", "<leader>b", function() print("bar") end, { nowait = true } },
}
```

To disable any single mapping without disabling them all, set its `{rhs}` to
`false`:

```lua
  view = {
    -- Disable the default normal mode mapping for `<tab>`:
    ["<tab>"] = false,
    -- Disable the default visual mode mapping for `gf`:
    { "x", "gf", false },
  }
```

Most of the mapped file panel actions also work from the view if they are added
to the view maps (and vice versa). The exception is for actions that only
really make sense specifically in the file panel, such as `next_entry`,
`prev_entry`. Actions such as `toggle_stage_entry` and `restore_entry` work
just fine from the view. When invoked from the view, these will target the file
currently open in the view rather than the file under the cursor in the file
panel.

## Restoring Files

If the right side of the diff is showing the local state of a file, you can
restore the file to the state from the left side of the diff (key binding `X`
from the file panel by default). The current state of the file is stored in the
git object database, and a command is echoed that shows how to undo the change.

## Tips and FAQ

- **Hide untracked files:**
  - `DiffviewOpen -uno`
- **Exclude certain paths:**
  - `DiffviewOpen -- :!exclude/this :!and/this`
- **Run as if git was started in a specific directory:**
  - `DiffviewOpen -C/foo/bar/baz`
- **Diff the index against a git rev:**
  - `DiffviewOpen HEAD~2 --cached`
  - Defaults to `HEAD` if no rev is given.
- **Q: How do I get the diagonal lines in place of deleted lines in
  diff-mode?**
  - A: Change your `:h 'fillchars'`:
    - (vimscript): `set fillchars+=diff:╱`
    - (Lua): `vim.opt.fillchars:append { diff = "╱" }`
  - Note: whether or not the diagonal lines will line up nicely will depend on
    your terminal emulator. The terminal used in the screenshots is Kitty.
