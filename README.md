# Diffview.nvim

Single tabpage interface for easily cycling through diffs for all modified files
for any git rev.

## Introduction

Vim's diff mode is pretty good, but there is no convenient way to quickly bring
up all modified files in a diffsplit. This plugin aims to provide a simple,
unified, single tabpage interface that lets you easily review all changed files
for any git rev.

## Requirements

- Git
- Neovim >=0.5.0
- [plenary.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim)
- [nvim-web-devicons](https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-web-devicons) (optional) For file icons

## Installation

Install the plugin with your package manager of choice.

```vim
" Plug
Plug 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim'
Plug 'sindrets/diffview.nvim'
```

```lua
-- Packer
use { 'sindrets/diffview.nvim', requires = 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim' }
```

</p>

The diff windows can be aligned either with a horizontal split or a vertical
split. To change the alignment add either `horizontal` or `vertical` to your
`'diffopt'`.

Most of the file panel mappings should also work from the view if they are
added to the view bindings (and vice versa). The exception is for mappings
that only really make sense specifically in the file panel, such as
`next_entry`, `prev_entry`, and `select_entry`. Functions such as
`toggle_stage_entry` and `restore_entry` work just fine from the view. When
invoked from the view, these will target the file currently open in the view
rather than the file under the cursor in the file panel.

### Hooks

The `hooks` table allows you to define callbacks for various events emitted from
Diffview. The available hooks are documented in detail in
`:h diffview-config-hooks`. The hook events are also available as User
autocommands. See `:h diffview-user-autocmds` for more details.

Examples:

```lua
hooks = {
  diff_buf_read = function(bufnr)
    -- Change local options in diff buffers
    vim.opt_local.wrap = false
    vim.opt_local.list = false
    vim.opt_local.colorcolumn = { 80 }
  end,
  view_opened = function(view)
    print(
      ("A new %s was opened on tab page %d!")
      :format(view:class():name(), view.tabpage)
    )
  end,
}
```

### Available Unused Mappings

This section documents key-mappable functions that are not mapped by default.

- `focus_entry`
  - Like `select_entry`, but also bring the cursor to the right diff split.
    Available in both the file panel and the file history panel.
- `goto_file_edit`
  - Works like `goto_file` except instead of creating a new
    split it will just open the file in the last accessed window.

## File History

![file-history-multi](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2786478/131269782-f4184640-6d73-4226-b425-feccb5002dd0.png)

The file history view allows you to list all the commits that changed a given
file or directory, and view the changes made in a diff split. Open a file
history view for your current file by calling `:DiffviewFileHistory`.

## Usage

### `:DiffviewOpen [git rev] [args] [ -- {paths...}]`

Calling `:DiffviewOpen` with no args opens a new Diffview that compares against
the current index. You can also provide any valid git rev to view only changes
for that rev. Examples:

- `:DiffviewOpen`
- `:DiffviewOpen HEAD~2`
- `:DiffviewOpen HEAD~4..HEAD~2`
- `:DiffviewOpen d4a7b0d`
- `:DiffviewOpen d4a7b0d..519b30e`
- `:DiffviewOpen origin/main...HEAD`

You can also provide additional paths to narrow down what files are shown:

- `:DiffviewOpen HEAD~2 -- lua/diffview plugin`

For information about additional `[args]`, visit the [documentation](https://github.com/sindrets/diffview.nvim/blob/main/doc/diffview.txt).

Additional commands for convenience:

- `:DiffviewClose`: Close the current diffview. You can also use `:tabclose`.
- `:DiffviewToggleFiles`: Toggle the files panel.
- `:DiffviewFocusFiles`: Bring focus to the files panel.
- `:DiffviewRefresh`: Update stats and entries in the file list of the current
  Diffview.

With a Diffview open and the default key bindings, you can cycle through changed
files with `<tab>` and `<s-tab>` (see configuration to change the key bindings).

### `:DiffviewFileHistory [paths] [args]`

Opens a new file history view that lists all commits that changed a given file
or directory. If no `[paths]` are given, defaults to the current file. Multiple
`[paths]` may be provided. If you want to view the file history for all changed
files for every commit, simply call `:DiffviewFileHistory .` (assuming your cwd
is the top level of the git repository).

## Tips

- **Hide untracked files:**
  - `DiffviewOpen -uno`
- **Exclude certain paths:**
  - `DiffviewOpen -- :!exclude/this :!and/this`
- **Run as if git was started in a specific directory:**
  - `DiffviewOpen -C/foo/bar/baz`
- **Diff the index against a git rev:**
  - `DiffviewOpen HEAD~2 --cached`
  - Defaults to `HEAD` if no rev is given.
- **Change the fill char for the deleted lines in diff-mode:**
  - (vimscript): `set fillchars+=diff:╱`
  - Note: whether or not the diagonal lines will line up nicely will depend on
    your terminal emulator.

## Restoring Files

If the right side of the diff is showing the local state of a file, you can
restore the file to the state from the left side of the diff (key binding `X`
from the file panel by default). The current state of the file is stored in the
git object database, and a command is echoed that shows how to undo the change.
