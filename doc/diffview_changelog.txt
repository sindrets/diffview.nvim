PR: https://github.com/sindrets/diffview.nvim/pull/137

The minimum required version has been bumped to Neovim 0.7.0, as the plugin
now uses some of the API functions provided in this release.

                                                *diffview.changelog-136*

PR: https://github.com/sindrets/diffview.nvim/pull/136

This PR refactors the internal representation of a panel (the various
interactive windows used in the plugin). The way panels are configured has
been changed and extended in a manner that is incompatible with the way it was
done before. To update your config, just move all the window related options
into a new table key `win_config`:

        Before: ~
>
                require("diffview").setup({
                  -- ...
                  file_panel = {
                    position = "left",
                    width = 35,
                    height = 16,
                    -- (Other options...)
                  },
                })
<
        After: ~
>
                require("diffview").setup({
                  -- ...
                  file_panel = {
                    win_config = {
                      position = "left",
                      width = 35,
                      height = 16,
                    },
                    -- (Other options...)
                  },
                })
<
This goes for both the `file_panel` and the `file_history_panel` config. To
see all the available options for `win_config`, see
|diffview-config-win_config|.

                                                *diffview.changelog-93*

PR: https://github.com/sindrets/diffview.nvim/pull/93

The plugin will from here on out require `plenary.nvim`:
https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim

I'm using plenary for it's async utilities as well as job management. To
update, just make sure plenary is loaded before diffview. Examples:

        Packer:~
            `use { 'sindrets/diffview.nvim', requires = 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim' }`

        Plug:~
            `Plug 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim'`
            `Plug 'sindrets/diffview.nvim'`

                                                *diffview.changelog-64*

PR: https://github.com/sindrets/diffview.nvim/pull/64

This PR introduces some small breaking changes in the config, and for plugins
integrating diffview.nvim.

The `use_icons` config table key has been moved out of the `file_panel` table.
This has been done because `use_icons` now applies to other contexts than just
the file panel. The correct way to configure this now is to set `use_icons`
somewhere from the top level of the config table.

For plugins integrating diffview.nvim:
Several of the git utilities have been refactored into their own namespace
(`lua/diffview/git/`). I (STS) felt this was necessary due to the growing
scope of the plugin. Most notably this means that the `Rev` class now resides
in `lua/diffview/git/rev.lua`.
