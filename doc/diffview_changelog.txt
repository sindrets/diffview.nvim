PR: https://github.com/sindrets/diffview.nvim/pull/64

This PR introduces some small breaking changes in the config, and for plugins
integrating diffview.nvim.

The `use_icons` config table key has been moved out of the `file_panel` table.
This has been done because `use_icons` now applies to other contexts than just
the file panel. The correct way to configure this now is to set `use_icons`
somewhere from the top level of the config table.

For plugins integrating diffview.nvim:
Several of the git utilities have been refactored into their own namespace
(`lua/diffview/git/`). I (STS) felt this was necessary due to the growing
scope of the plugin. Most notably this means that the `Rev` class now resides
in `lua/diffview/git/rev.lua`.
