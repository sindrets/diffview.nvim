Single tabpage interface to easily cycle through diffs for all modified files
for any git rev.

==============================================================================

INTRODUCTION                                       *diffview-nvim-introduction*

Vim's diff mode is pretty good, but there is no convenient way to quickly bring
up all modified files in a diffsplit. This plugin aims to provide a simple,
unified, single tabpage interface that lets you easily review all changed files
for any git rev.

USAGE                                                   *diffview-nvim-usage*

Quick-start: `:DiffviewOpen` to open a Diffview that compares against the
index.

You can have multiple Diffviews open, tracking different git revs. Each Diffview
opens in its own tabpage. To close and dispose of a Diffview, call either
`:DiffviewClose` or `:tabclose` while a Diffview is the current tabpage.
Diffviews are automatically updated:

        - Every time you enter a Diffview
        - On |BufWritePost|
        - On |FugitiveChanged|

Updates are not run unless the current tabpage is a Diffview.

CONFIGURATION                                   *diffview-nvim-configuration*

LAYOUT                                                *diffview-nvim-layout*

The diff windows can be aligned either with a horizontal split or a vertical
split. To change the alignment add either `horizontal` or `vertical` to your
'diffopt'.

COMMANDS                                            *diffview-nvim-commands*

                                                        *:DiffviewOpen*
:DiffviewOpen [git-rev] [args] [ -- {paths...}]
                        Opens a new Diffview that compares against [git-rev].
                        If no [git-rev] is given, defaults to comparing
                        against the index. Additional {paths...} can be
                        provided to narrow down what files are shown. If the
                        `-C` flag is not defined, the git root is determined
                        from the current buffer when possible. Otherwise it's
                        determined from the cwd.
                        Examples:
>
        :DiffviewOpen
        :DiffviewOpen HEAD~2
        :DiffviewOpen HEAD~4..HEAD~2
        :DiffviewOpen d4a7b0d
        :DiffviewOpen d4a7b0d..519b30e
        :DiffviewOpen origin/main...HEAD
        :DiffviewOpen HEAD~2 -- lua/diffview plugin
        :DiffviewOpen d4a7b0d -uno
<
    Args:
        -u[value], --untracked-files[={value}]
                        Specify whether or not to show untracked files. If
                        flag is given without value; defaults to `true`.
                        {value} can be one of:
                          - `true`, `normal`, `all` Show untracked.
                          - `false`, `no` Don't show untracked.
        --cached, --staged
                        Diff staged changes against [git-rev]. If no [git-rev]
                        is given, defaults to `HEAD`.

        -C{path}        Run as if git was started in {path} instead of the
                        current working directory.

                                                        *:DiffviewFileHistory*
:DiffviewFileHistory [paths]
                        Opens a new file history view that lists all commits
                        that changed a given file or directory. If no [paths]
                        are given, defaults to the current file. Multiple
                        [paths] may be provided.

                        From the file history panel (the panel listing the
                        commits) you can open an option panel by pressing
                        `g!`. The option panel will allow you to change the
                        flags that will be passed to `git-log`. A flag can
                        be adjusted either by moving the cursor to its line
                        followed by pressing <Tab>, or by using the mappings
                        that are shown directly in the panel, preceding the
                        flags' descriptions.

                                                        *:DiffviewClose*
:DiffviewClose          Close the active Diffview.

                                                        *:DiffviewToggleFiles*
:DiffviewToggleFiles    Toggles the files panel.

                                                        *:DiffviewFocusFiles*
:DiffviewFocusFiles     Brings focus to the file panel. Opens it if it's closed.

                                                        *:DiffviewRefresh*
:DiffviewRefresh        Update stats and entries in the file list of the
                        current Diffview.

MAPS                                                    *diffview-nvim-maps*

All listed maps are the defaults, but all mappings can be configured. Most of
the file panel mappings should also work from the view if they are added to
the view bindings (and vice versa). The exception is for mappings that only
really make sense specifically in the file panel, such as `next_entry`,
`prev_entry`, and `select_entry`. Functions such as `toggle_stage_entry` and
`restore_entry` work just fine from the view. When invoked from the view,
these will target the file currently open in the view rather than the file
under the cursor in the file panel.

View maps~

These maps are available in the diff buffers while a Diffview is the current
tabpage.

j                       Bring the cursor to the next file entry
<Down>

X                       Revert the selected file entry to the state from the
                        left side of the diff. This only works if the right
                        side of the diff is showing the local state of the
                        file. A command is echoed that shows how to undo the
                        change. Check `:messages` to see it again.

                                             *diffview-nvim-maps-refresh_files*

panel will allow you to change the flags that will be passed to `git-log`. A
flag can be adjusted either by moving the cursor to its line followed by
pressing <Tab>, or by using the mappings that are shown directly in the
panel, preceding the flags' descriptions.
