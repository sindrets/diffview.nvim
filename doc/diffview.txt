Single tabpage interface to easily cycle through diffs for all modified files
for any git rev.

INTRODUCTION                                            *diffview-introduction*

Vim's diff mode is pretty good, but there is no convenient way to quickly bring
up all modified files in a diffsplit. This plugin aims to provide a simple,
unified, single tabpage interface that lets you easily review all changed files
for any git rev.

USAGE                                                        *diffview-usage*

Quick-start: `:DiffviewOpen` to open a Diffview that compares against the
index.

You can have multiple Diffviews open, tracking different git revs. Each Diffview
opens in its own tabpage. To close and dispose of a Diffview, call either
`:DiffviewClose` or `:tabclose` while a Diffview is the current tabpage.
Diffviews are automatically updated:

        - Every time you enter a Diffview
        - On |BufWritePost|
        - On |FugitiveChanged|

Updates are not run unless the current tabpage is a Diffview.

CONFIGURATION                                                *diffview-config*

Example configuration with default settings:

enhanced_diff_hl                            *diffview-config-enhanced_diff_hl*
        Type: `boolean`, Default: `false`

        Enable/disable enhanced diff highlighting. When enabled, |hl-DiffAdd|
        in the left diff buffer will be highlighted as |hl-DiffDelete|, and
        the delete fill-chars will be highlighted more subtly.

default_args                                    *diffview-config-default_args*
        This table allows you to define the default args that will always be
        prepended to the arg-list for the commands specified by the table
        keys.

        Examples: >
                default_args = {
                  DiffviewOpen = { "--untracked-files=no", "--imply-local" }
                }

AVAILABLE UNUSED MAPPINGS                 *diffview-available-unused-mappings*

This section documents key-mappable functions that are not mapped by default.

focus_entry                                     *diffview-config-focus_entry*
        Like `select_entry`, but also bring the cursor to the right diff split.
        Available in both the file panel and the file history panel.

LAYOUT                                                     *diffview-layout*

The diff windows can be aligned either with a horizontal split or a vertical
split. To change the alignment add either `horizontal` or `vertical` to your
'diffopt'.

COMMANDS                                                 *diffview-commands*

                                                        *:DiffviewOpen*
:DiffviewOpen [git-rev] [args] [ -- {paths...}]
                        Opens a new Diffview that compares against [git-rev].
                        If no [git-rev] is given, defaults to comparing
                        against the index. Additional {paths...} can be
                        provided to narrow down what files are shown. If the
                        `-C` flag is not defined, the git root is determined
                        from the current buffer when possible. Otherwise it's
                        determined from the cwd.
                        Examples:
>
        :DiffviewOpen
        :DiffviewOpen HEAD~2
        :DiffviewOpen HEAD~4..HEAD~2
        :DiffviewOpen d4a7b0d
        :DiffviewOpen d4a7b0d..519b30e
        :DiffviewOpen origin/main...HEAD
        :DiffviewOpen HEAD~2 -- lua/diffview plugin
        :DiffviewOpen d4a7b0d -uno
<
    Args:
        -u[value], --untracked-files[={value}]
                        Specify whether or not to show untracked files. If
                        flag is given without value; defaults to `true`.
                        {value} can be one of:
                          - `true`, `normal`, `all` Show untracked.
                          - `false`, `no` Don't show untracked.
        --cached, --staged
                        Diff staged changes against [git-rev]. If no [git-rev]
                        is given, defaults to `HEAD`.

        --imply-local   If a range rev is provided and either end of the range
                        points to `HEAD`: point that end to local files
                        instead (not created from git). This can be useful
                        i.e. when using symmetric difference ranges
                        (triple-dot), but you want to be able to utilize the
                        LSP features that are not available while you're
                        viewing files created from git.

        -C{path}        Run as if git was started in {path} instead of the
                        current working directory.

                                                        *:DiffviewFileHistory*
:DiffviewFileHistory [paths]
                        Opens a new file history view that lists all commits
                        that changed a given file or directory. If no [paths]
                        are given, defaults to the current file. Multiple
                        [paths] may be provided.

                        From the file history panel (the panel listing the
                        commits) you can open an option panel by pressing
                        `g!`. The option panel will allow you to change the
                        flags that will be passed to `git-log`. A flag can
                        be adjusted either by moving the cursor to its line
                        followed by pressing <Tab>, or by using the mappings
                        that are shown directly in the panel, preceding the
                        flags' descriptions.

                                                        *:DiffviewClose*
:DiffviewClose          Close the active Diffview.

                                                        *:DiffviewToggleFiles*
:DiffviewToggleFiles    Toggles the files panel.

                                                        *:DiffviewFocusFiles*
:DiffviewFocusFiles     Brings focus to the file panel. Opens it if it's closed.

                                                        *:DiffviewRefresh*
:DiffviewRefresh        Update stats and entries in the file list of the
                        current Diffview.

MAPS                                                           *diffview-maps*

All listed maps are the defaults, but all mappings can be configured. Most of
the file panel mappings should also work from the view if they are added to
the view bindings (and vice versa). The exception is for mappings that only
really make sense specifically in the file panel, such as `next_entry`,
`prev_entry`, and `select_entry`. Functions such as `toggle_stage_entry` and
`restore_entry` work just fine from the view. When invoked from the view,
these will target the file currently open in the view rather than the file
under the cursor in the file panel.

                                                      *diffview-file-inference*
File inference~

Mappings that target a file will infer the target file according to a set of
simple rules:

        - If the cursor is in one of the diff buffers, the target file will be the
          file being compared.
        - If the cursor is in a file panel, the target file will be determined by
          the entry under the cursor.

                                                           *diffview-maps-view*
View maps~

These maps are available in the diff buffers while a Diffview is the current
tabpage.

                                              *diffview-maps-select_next_entry*
<Tab>                   Open the diff for the next file.

                                              *diffview-maps-select_prev_entry*
<S-Tab>                 Open the diff for the previous file.

                                                     *diffview-maps-goto_file*
gf                      Open the local version of the file in a new split in a
                        different tabpage. This will target your previous
                        (last accessed) tabpage first. If you have no
                        non-diffview tabpages open, the file will open in a
                        new tabpage. See |diffview-nvim-file-inference| for
                        details on how the file target is determined.

                                               *diffview-maps-goto_file_split*
<C-w><C-f>              Open the local version of the file in a new split. See
                        |diffview-nvim-file-inference| for details on how the
                        file target is determined.

                                                 *diffview-maps-goto_file_tab*

                        See |diffview-nvim-file-inference| for details on how
                        the file target is determined.

                                                   *diffview-maps-toggle_files*
<leader>b               Toggle the file panel.

                                                    *diffview-maps-focus_files*
<leader>e               Bring focus to the file panel.

                                                    *diffview-maps-copy_hash*
y                       Copy the commit hash of the entry under the cursor.

                                                    *diffview-maps-file-panel*
File panel maps~

These maps are available in the file panel buffer.

                                                     *diffview-maps-next_entry*
j                       Bring the cursor to the next file entry
<Down>

                                                     *diffview-maps-prev_entry*
k                       Bring the cursor to the previous file entry
<Up>
